#### A simple raytrasing render on C.

  In this project I tried to implement basic rendering of primitive objects.
4 primitive shapes are available in the project: sphere, cylinder, plane and cone.
The program accepts a file with a specified scene at the input.
The camera angle in the scene can be changed.

The project was written according to the C code standard.
